# CS3 JupyterHub Community Technical Workshop 2024

The Workshop organized by [SUNET](https://sunet.se) as an informal event for the [CS3](https://www.cs3community.org/) JupyterHub Community.
The workshop will be held online on Wednesday, May 15, 2024, 13:00-17:00 CEST (Edit 20240320: extended workshop to 17:00 CEST to accomodate more presentations). Attendence is free of charge.

To participate, please register by sending an email to [drive@sunet.se](mailto:drive@sunet.se) with the subject "JupyterHub Workshop 2024" and your name and affiliation.

The workshop will be held in English on Zoom. A link to the Zoom meeting will be sent to all registered participants well in time for the workshop.

## Presentations

Ideally each institution represented will hold a presentation of their JupyterHub deployment.
Please indicate in your registration email if you are planning to do so, and we will add your institution's presentation to the schedule.
The slot for the presentation will be 15 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for questions.

After each hour of the presentations, we will have a 10 minutes break. Any additional time that is left after the presentations will be used for a free form discussion.
If we run out of presentations and/or other things to say before the four hours have passed, we will end the workshop early.
