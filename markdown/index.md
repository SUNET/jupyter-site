# JupyterHub @ SUNET

Sunet is deploying a JupyterHub installation for the SUNET Drive community.
In line with our policies we are releasing our efforts as free and open source software.

Please have a look at our github repository for more information on our [Nextcloud app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/integration_jupyterhub) and associated information on how we deploy our setup:

We are also organizing an online technical workshop for the CS3 community on 2024-05-15. Please register if you are so inclined:

Many thanks to both the [From Zero to JupyterHub](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/) project and the [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) project for the shoulders we are able to stand on.
